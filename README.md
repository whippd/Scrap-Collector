This is my old game that I've reuploaded so it can be played.
Theres probably a memory leak. Oh well!
This was made for Demonin's "mega incremental game jam™️", and came in second place. The results can be viewed at this link in Demonin's discord server. https://discord.com/channels/870849323401896027/870851325175427072/917926006231269398 https://discord.gg/SpPKXBzZGz
This was my first ever javascript project and first ever game, and is in its finished state.
There has been 1 bug fix released since the results of the game jam, so most things are the same as the submitted version.
